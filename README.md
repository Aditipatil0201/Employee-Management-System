# Employee-Management-System

Earlier systems were manual where there was no way of properly storing information. Employee
records were stored manually which lead to errors. There was no proper way of tracking employee
records. It was very difficult and required a lot of paperwork which makes the application time
consuming and not secured. There was no administrator which could handle the records. So there was
the need to develop a system which could manage all these things and reduce the paperwork.
Employee information system is easy to use application which is created to manage the employee
data. It is created to record the details of the employees. This reduces the dependency on the manual
system which could create errors.
The project is about Employee Management System. Here we have used Hashing Data Structure to
implement this Program.This system can easily help in tracking employee records. There is a search
feature which allows getting records of a specific employee. There is an administrator which can
add, edit, delete and save records . We have accepted login credentials like username and password
so admin and user can login through their specific username and passwords.We have performed
required validations at every stage of program.

**Types of Data Structure :**
1) Hash table:




**Why we used Hash Table over other data structure:**
Hash provides better synchronization than other data structures. Hash tables are more efficient than
search trees or other data structures. Hash provides constant time for searching, insertion and deletion
operations on average.
In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index
value. Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data. Thus, it becomes a
data structure in which insertion and search operations are very fast irrespective of the size of the
data.
